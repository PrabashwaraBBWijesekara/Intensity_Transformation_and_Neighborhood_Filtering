# Image Processing and Machine Vision Assignment 1
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Image Processing and Machine Vision 1st assignment from my 5th semester. This repository showcases the implementation of solutions to various questions focusing on Intensity Transformations and Neighborhood Filtering. Dive into the code to explore how these concepts are applied to real-world problems. Feel free to learn from, fork, or contribute to this repository by opening pull requests. Let's collaborate and enhance our understanding of image processing together. Together, we'll unravel the world within pixels and filters. Join me on this journey of visual perception and transformation!
